Re: CRAIGSLIST SHORTCUTS’ VIOLATIONS OF CRAIGSLIST’S LEGAL RIGHTS

Dear Mr. Randolph:

This firm is legal counsel for craigslist. craigslist owns and operates the craigslist website located at www.craigslist.org and its classified ad and related services.

Your Craigslist Shortcuts Google Chrome Extension and the related services you provide (“Craigslist Shortcuts”) violate craigslist’s legal rights in a variety of ways, all of which must immediately cease.

First, Craigslist Shortcuts interoperates with the craigslist website. Specifically, you advertise that “this extension . . . adds keyboard shortcuts to the existing Craigslist website.”

Second, Craigslist Shortcuts’ marketing infringes craigslist’s trademarks. craigslist owns trademark registrations for the “CRAIGSLIST” and “CL” marks. Your use of craigslist’s trademarks is unauthorized, and is likely to cause confusion, mistake, and to deceive the public as to any affiliation, connection, association, origin, sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of Craigslist Shortcuts by craigslist.

The above described conduct violates craigslist’s legal rights and at least the following Terms of Use (“TOU”)

* **USE**. You agree not to use or provide software (except for general purpose web browsers and email clients, or software expressly licensed by us) or services that interact or interoperate with CL, e.g. for downloading, uploading, posting, flagging, emailing, search, or mobile use. Robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, etc. are prohibited, as are misleading, unsolicited, unlawful, and/or spam postings/email. You agree not to collect users’ personal and/or contact information (“PI”).

**By this letter, craigslist DEMANDS that You IMMEDIATELY CEASE AND DESIST all violations of craigslist’s legal rights as described above, and otherwise.**

Please confirm the following in writing within five (5) days from the date of this letter:

1. You have ceased and will forever desist from all access to and use of craigslist’s website for any reason or purpose whatsoever, directly or through any other person or entity;
2. You have ceased and will forever desist from offering, selling, marketing, or distributing any software or services that interoperate with craigslist, including your Craigslist Shortcuts Google Chrome Extension; and 
3. You have ceased and will forever desist from using craigslist’s trademarks and creating or publishing software or services that contain craigslist’s trademark or any confusingly similar terms. craigslist reserves all rights, remedies, claims and causes of action available in law and in equity against you. You are also reminded of your legal obligation to preserve and prevent the destruction of any and all documents, data and other evidence (in any form) within your custody, possession or control related to all such activities.

Very truly yours,

Brian P. Hennessy

Hello Brian Hennessy.

The “Craigslist Shortcuts” extension was a script that I wrote to make it easier to browse many apartment listings when I was searching for housing in SF. At the time, there was a ton of spam in the apartment listings, and I wrote the extension to skip the spam and irrelevant results more quickly. The script was innocuous; all it did was add keyboard shortcuts J and K to move to the next and previous result on craigslist.org. At the time I wrote the script (April 2012), the terms did NOT prohibit productivity/accessibility scripts; I even checked before writing it. I also posted the extension to the Chrome Web Store with documentation that was succinct and purely descriptive of the extension itself; I did not think it was likely to imply any association with craigslist.

Since then, craigslist has abated the spam problem significantly and has also improved the results page to make it possible to see results on the map and preview the images from the results. This has lessened the need for my own script. I still think that it is a helpful little script and do not see why craigslist would be opposed to its use. Since you have pointed out that craigslist changed the terms in December 2013 to prohibit using it, I have “unpublished” the extension from the Chrome Web Store, so that it is no longer available at the URL (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/craigslist-shortcuts/fpkpfjpnegjenkallpheifeejplgfego). I have also uninstalled the extension from my own web browser to respect the new terms.

However, your three demands (that I stop using craigslist forever, stop writing software that interoperates with craigslist forever, and stop using your trademark or writing software containing it forever) go beyond the scope of your complaint and I cannot reasonably comply with them.
